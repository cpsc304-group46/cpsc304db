Using git for project management
    1. clone repo using:
        On terminal
        cd into whatever local directory you want these files to be stored at
        git clone https://github.com/cpsc304-group46/cpsc304db.git

    3. Making changes / adding features
        git checkout -b branchname
            - before making any changes make a branch!
            - branchname could be featurename, etc...
        (then atom . or subl . to open in your text editor and edit!)

    3. once change is made:
        git add .
            - adding changes to your branch
        git commit -m "messages/short description of what was done"
        git checkout master
            - switch branch to master
        git push origin branchname
            - pushing changes in branchname to master branch

    4. Make pull request on github
        https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-cli/open-pull-request-github
        after you "git push origin branchname"
        Make pull request detailing the changes/features.

    5. Once pull request is made, the branch will be merged with master branch after a review.
    Once branch merged w/ master branch, make sure to
        1) update your local copy of master branch
        git branch
            - to check you are in master branch
        git pull
        2) delete the previous branch you made for the edit
        git branch -d branchname
        
        now go back to step 3! (git checkout -b newbranchname)
